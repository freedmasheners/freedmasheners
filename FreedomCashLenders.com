When presented with possible components of the FreedomCashLenders.coms final regulation, borrowers said loans with lower prices, more affordable payments, and reasonable installment structures would be a major improvement, but most said a debt evaluation process or a limit on the number of installment loans they could use was “not an improvement” or only a “minor improvement.” The outcomes borrowers favored most were those that would probably result from the 5 percent payment option. The proposed rule relies heavily on a specific origination process that would make offering lower-cost installment loans at scale too difficult for banks and credit unions, but these institutions say they would be likely to offer such loans if the FreedomCashLenders.com includes the 5 percent payment option in its final rule.
